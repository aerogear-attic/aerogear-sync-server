## AeroGear Data Synchronization Project [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aerogear/aerogear-sync-server.png)](https://travis-ci.org/aerogear/aerogear-sync-server)
This project in an implementation of Google's [Differential Synchonrization](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub35605.html) 
by Neil Fraser, that can be used by AeroGear's client libraries.

## AeroGear Sync
AeroGear Sync consists of the following modules:

* [api](./api)  
Contains the interfaces for the server and client, plus definitions of common types.

* [core](./core)  
Contains a base implementation of the common types from the [api](./api) module. These are used by both the
[client-engine](./client/client-engine) and the [server-engine](./server/server-engine) modules.

* [server](./server)  
Contains a concrete implementation of the server side sync engine API. This implementation is intended to be "embedded" in a server
component, like a Servlet, a Netty server, etc.

* [client](./client)  
Contains a concrete implementation of the client side sync engine API. This implementation is intended to be "embedded" in a client
component, like a Netty client, an Android device, etc.

* [synchronizers](./synchronizers)  
Contains implementations that perform the synchronization operations in the Differential Synchronization algorithm.

* [distribution](./distribution)  
This module produces an executable jar. See _Creating a distribution_ below for more information

* [itests](./itests)  
Contains tests that use both the [server-engine](./server/server-engine) and [client-engine](./client/client-engine) in cooperation.

## Building

    mvn clean install

### Creating a distribution
A distribution (a "fat" jar) can be produces by running the following maven command from the [distribution](./distribution)
directory:

    mvn package

This willl produce a ```target/aerogear-sync-server-VERSION.jar``` file. This jar is executable and can be used to start
the JSON Patch server:

    java -jar target/aerogear-sync-server-VERSION.jar

## Usage

### Starting the JSON Patch server

    cd server/server-netty
    mvn exec:exec -Pjsonpatch
    
### Starting the DiffMatchPatch server

    cd server/server-netty
    mvn exec:exec -Pdiffmatch
