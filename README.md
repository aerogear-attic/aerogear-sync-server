## AeroGear Data Synchronization Project
This project aims to specify a data synchronization protocol that can be used by AeroGear's client libraries.

Data synchronziation is an important feature for mobile clients to enable offline working. Mobile devices can
work without a connection, and later when a connection becomes available, any changes made by the client should be
synchronized with the source of the data.

The master branch of this project is currently empty but will be populated we it has been decided on what approach 
we will take. 

There is a branch named [differential-synchronization](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-sync-server/tree/differential-synchronization)
that is a proof-of-concept for an option moving forward.
